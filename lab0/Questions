Macallyster S. Edmondson - ECE 351 - Lab #0 Deliverables - 01/25/2022

QUESTIONS:

1. Over last summer I continued with an internship with SEL Engineering Services - Protection up until December of this year. I recently just changed positions as an RTL intern in the 4xx group of Protection Systems in R&D and plan to hold this position through the rest of this semester, through the summer and into the next school year.

2. I am very excited to be doing math / signal processing with python for this lab. Most of my experience coding for mathematics is in MATLAB and Wolfram Mathematica. I have had some expereince with python and I am excited to build my skills with this course.
